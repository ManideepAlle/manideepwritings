#Proteins as drug targets

##Introduction
The process of a new drug discovery begins with the identification and validation of the potential target, which is then subjected to high through-put screening against a library of drugs like substances and rational drug designs. The features of a good drug target include: crucial involvement in the biological pathways, distinct from already known targets, characterized functionally and structurally, and druggable (capable of binding to small particles).[1]

##Main Body
Proteins that possess the protein folds that favours interactions with the drug like chemical compounds. Many proteins are druggable according to their structure but most of them does not show any therapeutic benefit [2]. Thus, all druggable proteins not necessary to be drug targets. Drug binding sites are expected to have certain structural and physicochemical properties with a high affinity for site-specific binding. Most of the proteins helps in the regulation of cellular functions and in biological process. This makes proteins as main target for therapeutic intervention. The understanding of how proteins manipulated to treat diseases helps in developing effective drugs [3].
###Types of Drug-Target Interactions
The interaction between a drug and its protein target is a complex process that typically involves binding of the drug to a specific site on the protein, leading to a modification of the protein’s activity. There are several ways drugs can target proteins:
1.	Inhibitors: These drugs bind to an active site on an enzyme or receptor, blocking the natural substrate or ligand and thereby inhibiting the protein's function. This is a common mechanism in cancer therapies, where the goal is often to inhibit proteins that promote uncontrolled cell growth.[4]
2.	Activators: In contrast to inhibitors, activators enhance the activity of a protein. These are less common but can be crucial in cases where boosting a protein’s function can restore normal cellular activity.[4]
3.	Allosteric Modulators: These drugs bind to a site other than the protein's active site, inducing a conformational change that affects the protein's function. Allosteric modulation allows for more subtle control of protein activity and is often associated with fewer side effects.[4]
4.	Proteolysis Targeting Chimeras (PROTACs): This innovative approach involves small molecules that target proteins for degradation. PROTACs bind to both the target protein and an E3 ubiquitin ligase, leading to the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of the target protein by the proteasome. This method is particularly useful for targeting proteins that are considered "undruggable" by conventional methods.[4]

##Conclusion
Proteins are at the heart of cellular function and disease, making them critical targets in the quest for new and effective therapies. While challenges remain, ongoing advances in technology and a deeper understanding of protein biology are opening up new possibilities for drug discovery. As we continue to explore the intricate world of proteins, the potential for developing targeted, effective treatments for a wide range of diseases is greater than ever.
This focus on proteins as drug targets is not just a cornerstone of modern medicine but a gateway to future therapeutic innovations that could transform the treatment landscape for countless patients worldwide.
